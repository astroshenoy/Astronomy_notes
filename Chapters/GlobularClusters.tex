\section{Globular Clusters vs Satellite galaxies}

Both globular clusters, as well as satellite galaxies, can be found in the halo of a primary galaxy. However, they are different. Satellite galaxies are not only more extended and diffuse compared to globular clusters but are also enshrouded in massive dark matter halos that are thought to have been endowed to them during the formation process. 

\section{Globular Clusters}

Formation of globular clusters may have a link with the formation of \textbf{ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs;} see \ref{UCDs}), star cluster size systems with mass in the range of 10$^6$ solar mass - 10$^8$ solar mass and half mass radii of 10-100 pc.
