\chapter{Dwarf and Satellite galaxies}

\section{Dwarf Galaxies}

Dwarf galaxies are at the low end of SFR but reveal extended metal polluted haloes around them (Burchett et al. 2015; Bordoloi et al. 2014), which could be a sign of stellar feedback. 


\section{Satellite galaxies}

A satellite galaxy is a smaller companion galaxy that travels on bound orbits within the gravitational potential of a more massive and luminous host galaxy (also known as the primary galaxy). While \textbf{most satellite galaxies are dwarf galaxies} - not all, satellite galaxies of large galaxy clusters can be much more massive. The Milky Way is orbited by about fifty satellite galaxies, the largest of which is the Large Magellanic Cloud.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Satellite galaxies are identified in photometric catalogues using statistical background subtraction.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Ultra compact dawrf galaxies} \label{UCDs}

\cite{2008Mieske} state that a striking outcome of previous studies is the finding that the dynamical M/L ratios of massive compact stellar systems (UCDs) are, on average, about two times larger than those of normal glob- ular clusters of comparable metallicity.
