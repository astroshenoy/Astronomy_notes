\section{Simulations vs Observations}

Computer simulations of the growth of galaxies suggest that dark-matter-dominated galaxies should have incredibly high densities in their centers. Observations of real galaxies do show higher densities in their cores, but not nearly enough as those simulations predicted. Also, simulations of dark matter evolving in the universe predict that every galaxy should have hundreds of smaller satellites, while observations consistently come up short.

\section{Alternate Hypotheses}

\subsection{MOND}
Under MOND, there's no need for an additional particles to explain the observations â€” just a slight tweaking of the gravitational force. And because the tweaking of gravity under MOND is explicitly designed to explain the motions of stars within galaxies, it naturally does that very well. The theory also doesn't suffer from the overproduction of satellites and the extremely high galactic cores of dark matter.
